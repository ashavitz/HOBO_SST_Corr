TODO
- Extract NOAA Geo-polar Blended Analysis Diurnal Correction (Day+Night) in SST_Data_Extract
- Change ACSPO name
- Finish extracting ACSPO ABI hourly data

-Extract ACSPO Global SST from ABI (GOES) data
  - There is no ERDDAP access and the data is hourly, so this requires accessing hourly netcdf data
    via the THREDDS server.
- Update Jill and Forest if GOES is different, and on details of the utilized data products
- Download depth for each GPS coordinate and include in model

# Questions for Tom about NECOFs model
- What is the timeframe of hindcast data available? For example, can we get all of 2025?
- How far out do the forecasts go? Could we forecast an entire field season?
- Is there descriptive metadata available? To better understand the file dimensions and variables.
- Is the geographical range limited to the mesh of points I made?
